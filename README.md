# Game description â€“ MemoryGame

1. Simple guessing and memory game based on the following Wikipedia article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_game
2. The game is written in Java 17
3. The game is divided into 5 classes (Main, FilesManagement, GameMechanics, Score and Board)
4. To start the game open and run main method in Main class.
5. Currently, the game has only 2 difficulty levels but the design makes it easy to increase
   the number of difficulty levels.
6. I tried to make sure that the game design and the game documentation make its update, maintenance,
   testing and bugs removal relatively easy.
