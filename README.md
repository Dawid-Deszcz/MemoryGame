##Why do I code?

I code because it is a fun distraction from my day-to-day tasks. For me, coding is like
making a LEGO_Technic car (finished code performing a specific task) from LEGO bricks (classes,
methods, statements, expressions) something you do as a hobby and not something you are paid to do.

I would love to work as a software developer full-time instead of trying to find time for programming
whenever my personal and professional responsibilities allow it. I only regret that I have not discovered
it earlier and had not been brave enough to make a career change a few years ago.

I have a well-paid job in clinical research. My work consists mainly of administrative and supervisory
tasks but also some degree of collaboration with software developers who had to design or amend custom-made
applications for our large and small-scale clinical projects.

I noticed that working with large data sets, automating boring tasks with Python and collaborations
with software engineers are favorite parts of my daily routine. This is why I decided to apply to Motorola
Solutions Academy because If I like my job now how much more I would like it when it consists only of software
development tasks? At the same time, there is a number of reasons why I would be a perfect addition to 
the Motorola family;
1. I am new to programming - which means that I will not have rigid difficult-to-change habits. Instead, 
I can be easily trained, and I can quickly adopt Motorola’s standard operating procedure.
I enjoy swimming and my swimming teacher always told me that it is easier to train a new swimmer than retrain
somebody who was taught badly. I suspect that it might be similar to software developer training.
2. I am fluent in English - I have an engineering degree (MSc in Biochemical Engineering at University College London)
and I lived and worked in the United Kingdom for almost 10 years.
3. I have corporate business experience, excellent soft skills and an excellent collaboration track record
(both within my company and with external service providers)  - which means that I will be able to easily adjust
to Motorola’s corporate environment.
4. I am a fast learner - I only learned how to use Git and GitHub on the 11th of August 2022 after I started
to work on the Memory Game task where submission via GitHub was a task requirement. I started learning Java
on the 6th of July 2022 after coming across the Motorola Academy Java backend developer job/training advertisement.
It was my first ever experience with Java and I had to work full-time in parallel. I know that there is still a lot
that I have to learn,  my OOP skills are nascent, and I need to learn  Git and documentation procedures but if
I achieved so much in a few weeks’ time then I am confident that after Motorola Academy training is finished
I will be able to provide good quality work to my team.
